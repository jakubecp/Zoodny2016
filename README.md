###English summary

Spatial analysis of occurence data of endangered Nicrophorinae are provided. The results were presented as poster at the conference Zoologicke dny 2016 in Ceske Budejovice (Czech Republic).

We calculated probable occurence of N. antennatus, N. germanicus, N. sepultor and N. vestigator with data provided by GBIF (www.gbif.org), D. Sikes and our own. The analysis was done by MaxEnt algorithm and as environmental variables we used all climatic layers (bio1-19) from Bioclim (http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim).
The maps present probable occurence with values of 0 or 1, which was obtained by reclasification of predictions by the value of logistic treshold of the maximum training sensitivity and specificity.
